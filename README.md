# 🏦 BankSight – Transaction Intelligence Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

**BankSight** is a banking analytics and transaction intelligence dashboard developed using **Python, SQL, Pandas, and Streamlit**.  
The application provides a unified platform to manage banking data, simulate transactions, and generate analytical insights through an interactive dashboard.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Banks generate large volumes of structured data such as:
- Customers
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Loans
- Support tickets  

Manual analysis of this data is inefficient and error-prone.  
**BankSight** solves this problem by offering a **centralized analytics dashboard** for data exploration, transaction simulation, and business insights.
